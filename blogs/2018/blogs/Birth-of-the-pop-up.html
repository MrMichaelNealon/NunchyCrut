		<h1>
			Birth of the pop-up
			<br /><br />
		</h1>
		
		<p>
			One of perhaps my most favourite entries in my great, 
			great, great, great, great Grandfather&#39;s journal 
			concerns something that we are all familiar with today, 
			the infamous <b>pop-up</b>.
			<br /><br />
			We might not see this as any technological achievment, 
			to people like us it&#39;s an every-day thing. But back 
			then it wasn&#39;t so easy!
			<br /><br />
		</p>
		
		<h1>
			Pastry
			<br /><br />
		</h1>
		
		<p>
			It all began in the summer of 1732. My ancestor was 
			busy working on a device that could boil a dozen eggs 
			in one go when he was contacted by one <b>Herbert 
			Nichol</b>, the local baker.
			<br /><br />
			Nichol, knowing of Rudyard&#39;s genius, commissioned 
			him to come up with a way to promote his business. Rudyard 
			was paid a farthing and given two strawberry tarts which 
			he immediately devoured.
			<br /><br />
			High on sugar, he got to work.
			<br /><br />
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			Catapulted into history
			<br /><br />
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			Rudyard, drawing inspiration from old medieval catapults 
			and other torture devices, designed a prototype application 
			that was to cause a media storm - he wrote:
			<br /><br />
		</p>
		
		<div class="quote">
			&quot;I constructed a device that acted just like a 
			catapult but with one major difference, it was triggered 
			when someone stepped on it.
			<br /><br />
			It was basically a see-saw buried in the ground, the 
			unwitting user would step on one end and the other end 
			would pop-up and stop about face-level, and on that would 
			be a picture of a cream bun and some text instructing 
			you to go and buy a cake&quot;
		</div>
		
		<div class="image-regular" style="float: right; margin-right: 0px;">
			<br />
			<img 
			title="Thinkwell drew inspiration from catapults." 
			align="right" 
			src="blogs/2018/images/Catapult.jpg" 
			width="100%" height="auto" 
			/>
			<p class="image-text" style="float: right;">
				Thinkwell drew inspiration from catapults.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>
			<br />
			After a few tweaks the device was deployed and put 
			into production.
			<br /><br />
			It wasn&#39;t long before the pop-up was triggered by 
			an unsuspecting member of the public - amazingly, the 
			pop-up was sprung by none other than <b>Mr Nichol</b>
			himself! The local butcher who had commissioned the 
			application became its first human guinea pig.
			<br /><br />
			Sadly, there was a bug in the prototype application and 
			poor Mr Nichol was beheaded by a projectile which had come 
			loose from the device -- Rudyard was promptly 
			arrested and placed on death row
			<br /><br />
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			Towers of hope
			<br /><br />
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			Imprisoned in the famous <b>Tower of London</b> and awaiting 
			execution, Rudyard set about debugging his flawed 
			application.
			<br /><br />
		</p>
	
		<div class="quote">
			&quot;I added more flour to the adhesive mix, it was now 2 
			parts flour to one part water whereas I had use a 1:1 ratio 
			with the first mix. This flour increase, though more expensive, 
			would bind the  parts more tightly to the see-saw and prevent 
			people from getting hurted.
			<br /><br />
			The problems with my application had been resolved, but 
			there was still the trifling matter of being on death 
			row!&quot;
		</div>
		
		<p>
			<br />
			Luckily for Rudyard, the judge later ruled that Nichol 
			had inadvertently committed suicide by comissioning the 
			project that killed him. Rudyard was set free.
			<br /><br />
			So now, with his freedom back and his device debugged 
			he released the first version of his new product and 
			took the world by storm!
