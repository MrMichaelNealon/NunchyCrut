		<h1>
			First ever blog post!
			<br /><br />
		</h1>
		
		<p>
			Welcome, my friends - this is a great day!
			<br /><br />
			The <b>NunchyCrut</b> brand has been reborn 
			and thrust out into the modern world to once 
			again become leaders and pioneers in the exciting 
			field of design and technology!
			<br /><br />
			If you know your history, you will know that my 
			great, great, great, great, great Grandfather was 
			an entrepreneur and a visionary. He played a 
			seminal role in the rise of the internet and 
			digital technology as we know it - this site is 
			dedicated to the memory of the great man himself,
			<b>Rev. Rudyard Thinkwell</b>.
			<br /><br />

		<h2>
			From journals to blogs
			<br /><br />
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			The painstaking translation of the journals belonging 
			to my ancestor is a mammoth undertaking, and so work is 
			ongoing.
			<br /><br />
			It is a delicate and very technical process that requires 
			great professional and academic prowess which is why I am 
			doing it myself in my spare time.
			<br /><br />
			As the process continues I will update the <b>blog</b> 
			with my findings. Please be patient, it&#39;s a biblical 
			and heroic effort.
			<br /><br />
			What I can promise you is information about the internet 
			that will change your life! So be sure to check the blog 
			section regularly for updates!
			<br /><br />

		<h2>
			My book
			<br /><br />
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			On a more sour note, I recently had my self-published 
			book removed from my Amazon store. They made some 
			ambiguous claim about plagiarism or misrepresentation or 
			something...I dunno. My lawyer understands it better,  
			I wasn&#39;t really paying attention.
			<br /><br />
			Anyways, naturally I am fighting this injustice - my book, 
			<b>Simon P. Thinkwell's <i>The Shining</i></b> will be 
			back in stores as soon as I thrash my opponents in court.
			<br /><br />
			So stay tuned, it&#39;s all happening at <b>NunchyCrut</b>!
			<br /><br />
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			Updates
			<br /><br />
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			It is difficult to say how often or with what frequency 
			I will update the blog section.
			<br /><br />
			I do <b>salsa</b> classes on a Tuesday evening, I go
			<b>rambling</b> every Sunday. I play <b>bingo</b> every second 
			Thursday and never miss an episode of <b>Eastenders</b> - 
			so quite a hectic schedule!
			<br /><br />
			I&#39;ll do what I can when I can, if I manage one blog 
			a week I&#39;ll be happy.
			<br /><br />
