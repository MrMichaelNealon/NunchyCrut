			Confrontational email
			<br /><br />
		</h1>
		
		<p>
			You know - I get a lot of emails from people, mostly 
			jealous, angry little people badmouthing me and my 
			ancestors.
			<br /><br />
			Normally I&#39;ll maintain a degree of professionalism 
			and not broadcast my abusive responses because they&#39;re 
			just stupid little idiots who don&#39;t know what they&#39;re 
			talking about usually.
			<br /><br />
			I am <i><b>better</b></i> than that!
			<br /><br />
			But this time I am making an exception. This morning I 
			opened my inbox to find... this:
		</p>
		
		<div class="email-text">
				Dear Mr Thinkwell,
				<br /><br />
				I was on your, ahem... &quot;website&quot; the other day.
				<br /><br />
				I don't know whar struck me more -- the numerous
				inconsistencies which I won&#39;t bother listing, or the 
				outright lies you are telling.
				<br /><br />
				You make ridiculous, outlandish claims - for example, your 
				great, great, great, great, great Grandfather developed the 
				first ever framework using leaves and twigs! Do you honestly
				expect people to take you seriously? I mean, come on! You 
				don&#39;t even attempt to provide any evidence.
				<br /><br />
				It&#39;s downright absurd. Is it just a coincidence that 
				3 months ago you released a book, saw miserable sales then 
				all of a sudden find these fabled &quot;journals&quot; 
				supposedly written by your ancestor revealing the hidden 
				history of the internet and web development?
				<br /><br />
				Even now that you are <b>media whoring</b> yourself online, 
				telling fanciful tales your book still isn&#39;t selling, 
				because people see right through your incredible bullshit, 
				plus your book is stupid. If possible, it probably contains 
				more lies and inconsistncies than your moronic website.
				<br /><br />
				You make it all up, in fact I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if 
				you fabricated this email because you&#39;re no content on 
				your lame little website. You&#39;re nothing more than a 
				snake-oil salesman and a charlatan!
				<br /><br />
				Loser.
				<br /><br />
		</div>

		<p>
			Now, you know what...I&#39;m not even going to lower 
			myself by responding to this crap, it is <i><b>beneath
			</b></i> me.
			<br /><br />
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Firstly - I find it telling that you apparently found 
			numerous inconsistencies on my site yet you refuse to 
			list them. This site was originally built in the 70&#39;s 
			using a stack of technologies too low-level and complex 
			for you to understand let alone put to any good use.
			<br /><br />
			Secondly - the evidence is all around you. The images, the 
			anecdotes, the compilation of the journals into blogs. Or 
			I suppose you are suggesting the journals don&#39;t actually 
			exist, in which case where did I get all of this information?
			<br /><br />
			Are you suggesting I made it up? You have no idea what you 
			are dealing with here, I <i>know <b>real</b></i> people!
			<br /><br />
			And as for my book, I&#39;d love to see you write one, 
			you can barely even string an email together...we know I 
			didn&#39;t write this email because it is nothing more than the 
			insane ramblings of a small, petty little man who has done 
			<b>NOTHING</b> with his miserable, sorry little life.
			<br /><br />
			You know what Mr. Anonymous...you are beneath my level, I&#39;m 
			not even going to entertain you. And why not reveal your name 
			anyway, eh? Scared? Scared...little stupid little scaredy cat, 
			hiding behind your anonymous emails like a frightened little 
			girl.
			<br /><br />
			Come down here...come down here and we can sort this out 
			like men! You won&#39;t though because you know what will 
			happen. But you know what, I&#39;m not even bothered by 
			what you say or think, I&#39;m not even going to waste my 
			time responsing.
			<br /><br />
			I am <i><b>above</b></i> that.
			<br /><br />
