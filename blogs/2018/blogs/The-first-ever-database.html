		<h1>
			The first ever database
			<br /><br />
		</h1>
		
		<p>
			Having made quite a name for himself so early in his 
			career, Rudyard decided to expand his empire by branching 
			out into other areas.
			<br /><br />
		</p>
		
		<div class="quote">
			&quot;I wanted to modify my pop-up contraption in such a 
			way that it could change the advert. This way I could have 
			one for say...a butcher, one for a baker, I could maybe 
			even have one for a candlestick maker!
			<br /><br />
			This dynamic model would require a means by which I could 
			store information and quickly change the contents of the pop-up on 
			the fly...or should I say on the bee? Ha ha ha!&quot;
		</div>
		
		<p>
			<br />
			After racking his brains for a few weeks, Rudyard came up 
			with the an ingenious solution, he would store the data in 
			<b>bee hives</b> and use the bees themselves as a sort of 
			transportation-twixed rendering protocol...
			<br /><br />
		</p>
		
		<div class="quote">
			&quot;I had acquired a beehive as a gift from my niece, it 
			suddenly struck me that I could train bees to store honey 
			and use the honey to quickly render the advertisment onto the 
			face of my pop-up.
			<br /><br />
			I removed a thin slither of bee hive, it had all them hexagons 
			and honey on it, I got stang multiple times but I was soon 
			friends with the bees and they responded to my instructions. 
			I spent some weeks  training the bees to store the honey in 
			the little hexagons then retrieve it, and smear it on the face
			of the pop-up to construct a dynamic advert - it worked!

		<h2>
			<br />
			Rock star
			<br /><br />
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			Now, with his new database feature, Rudyard set to work. He 
			strapped the thin slither of bee hive to his contraption and 
			set up a test, deploying his device in a field just outside 
			Birmingham.
			<br /><br />
			Sure that his device would be a huge success, he tucked in to 
			some <b>Mr Kipling</b> bramley apple tarts and a bottle of 
			<b>Frijj</b> strawberry milkshake and waited to become a 
			rock star.
			<br /><br />
		</p>
		
		<div class="quote">
			&quot;I waited patiently for the new pop-up to be triggered, 
			it took a day or two but soon I got word that it had been 
			sprung, and it had worked!
			<br /><br />
			Unfortunately, as with the previous release there was a 
			bug and the unwitting user was stang in the face multiple 
			times and died due to an allergic reaction. I was immediately 
			put on death row!
		</div>
		
		<p>
			<br />
			Rudyard wa again awaiting execution. But, as ever - he was determined not 
			to let it get him down, he continued to work on a solution to his 
			problem while on death row for the second time in his career.
			<br /><br />

			Genetics
			<br /><br />
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			While in prison, Rudyard had concluded that the best 
			solution would be to breed a species of bee that doesn&#39;t 
			feature a stinger, but in the end he decided instead that 
			it&#39;d be easier to simply snap the stingers off of the 
			bees that he already had.
			<br /><br />
			After being in prison for some hours, Rudyard was granted 
			a royal pardon when a sympathetic Queen learnt that he too had been 
			stang by the bees - Rudyard was again a free man.
			<br /><br />
		</p>
		
		<div class="quote">
			&quot;I immediately set to work, snapping the stingers off 
			of all my bees, and I got stang plenty of times in the process 
			of doing so.
			<br /><br />
			After several painstaking hours I had a hive full of 
			stingless bees. I threw together another prototype and 
			again deployed, this time in a forest near Slough.
			<br /><br />
		</div>
		
		<p>
			<br />
			Thinkwell waited again for his pop-up to be triggered, and 
			less than an hour after deployment it was and with great 
			success - Rudyard had done it again, making his first 
			<b>million shillings</b> with the release of version 2 of his pop-up 
			device.
