				My name is <b>Professor Simon P. Thinkwell</b>, I am 
				the creator and administrator of this site and this 
				is my story...
				<br /><br />
				In the year <b>1832</b> my <i>great, great, great, great, great</i> 
				Grandfather, the late and much celebrated <b>Pastor 
				Rudyard Thinkwell</b> was born.
				<br /><br />

					Rev. Rudyard Thinkwell, circa 1776
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				Thinkwell, as you probably know, was a decorated world 
				war veteran, treasure hunter, deep sea diver, adventurer, 
				and of course inventor!
				<br /><br />
				One of the things Rudyard is not well credited for, and 
				he should be, is inventing what we now know as 
				<b>the website</b>.
				<br /><br />
			</p>
			
			<h2>
				The discovery
				<br /><br />
			</h2>
			
			<p>
				It all started about 2 months ago when I found a dirty old 
				sea-chest in the attic. This thing was crawling with lice 
				and barnacle-encrusted sputum but I managed to prize it 
				open...and what was inside was to change my life forever!
				<br /><br />
				Treasure? No, even better! I found piles and piles of 
				filthy, stinky old documents that had almost completely
				rotted, the text practically illegible. But after  
				painstaking restoration work we were able to make some 
				startling discoveries about what we now know as <b>the 
				internet</b>.
				<br /><br />
			</p>
			
			<div class="image-regular" style="float: right; margin-right: 0px;">
				<img 
				title="The NunchyCrut Headquarters, circa 1706" 
				align="right" 
				src="images/NunchycrutHeadquarters.png" 
				width="100%" height="auto" 
				/>
				<p class="image-text" style="float: right;">
					The NunchyCrut headquarters, circa 1706.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>
				Now - here is the shockng part, the internet has existed 
				for <b>centuries!!!</b> That&#39;s right, we can trace it 
				back as far as the early <b>1800&#39;s</b> and my great, 
				great, great, great, great, great grandfather was at the
				heart of  it all back then... so he was.
				<br /><br />
			</p>
			
			<h2>
				Ramblings
				<br /><br />
			</h2>
			
			<p>
				Amid the reams of insane ramblings were tales of how the 
				very first websites were hand-coded in cave painting format, 
				tutorials on how to carve <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> and <b>
				&lt;a&gt;</b> tags out of rock and wood. We were amazed at 
				what we found.
				<br /><br />
				The writings chronicle everything from the birth of the 
				very first <b>pop-up</b> to responsive layouts crafted 
				with <b>Spandex</b> and <b>Lycra</b>. We wil learn all 
				about Rudyard and his famous <b>NunchyCrut</b> web 
				design studio in <b>Stoke on Trent</b>&#39;s infamous 
				<b>Coal Valley</b>.
				<br /><br />
			</p>
			
			<h2>
				Blog
				<br /><br />
			</h2>
			
			<p>
				The very day I discovered these journals I immediately began 
				compiling this information into a website where I proudly 
				present Rudyard&#39;s writings in the form of a blog.
				<br /><br />
			</p>
		
			<div class="image-regular" style="float: right; margin-right: 0px;">
				<img 
				title="Rudyard's first ever search engine." 
				align="right" 
				src="images/FirstWebsite.jpg" 
				width="100%" height="auto" 
				/>
				<p class="image-text" style="float: right;">
					Rudyard&#39;s first search engine.
				</p>
			</div>
		
			<p>
				The blog section will provide you with transcribed 
				extracts from my great, great, great, great, great,
				great...great grandafather&#39;s journals in chronological 
				order so that you can trace the secret history of the 
				internet!
				<br /><br />
				You will be astounded by the sheer inventive genius 
				behind concepts we new take for granted.
				<br /><br />
				So read, learn and enjoy!
