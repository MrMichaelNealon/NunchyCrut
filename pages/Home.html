			Welcome!
			<br /><br />
		</h1>
		
		<p>
			Welcome one and all to my wonderful website which I 
			built with my own bare hands.
			<br /><br />
			This site is dedicated to the memory of my great, 
			great, great, great, great, great Grandfather, the 
			right-honorable <b>Rev. Rudyard Thinkwell</b>.
			<br /><br />
			If you want to know more about Rudyard then check out 
			the <b>About</b> section, or head over to the <b>Blog</b> 
			section where I regularly post excerpts of his fascinating 
			journals.
			<br /><br />
			I hope you enjoy your time here - and most importantly, 
			I hope you learn something!
			<br /><br />

		<p>
			My name is <b>Simon P. Thinkwell</b> and I am a 
			computer historian, professor and self-published 
			author.
			<br /><br />
			My journey began when I discovered the truth about 
			the internet, abut the lies and secrecy surrounding it.
			<br /><br />
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			The grand deception
			<br /><br />
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			The common belief is that the internet is a man-made 
			network of computers linked toghether by wires and 
			magic wireless signals.
			<br /><br />
			This is what we are told to believe from an early 
			age and the poor, ignorant <i>sheeple</i> are too brainwashed 
			to see the truth. They are <i>asleep</i>, believing whatever 
			nefarious organisations like <b>Facebook</b> and 
			<b>Elon Musk</b> tells them.
			<br /><br />
			But they are all in on it - not one single person can 
			produce an image of these &quot;wi-fi&quot; signals, 
			nor can they show me a photo of the place where all of 
			these <i>magic wires</i> join this massive, alleged network.
			<br /><br />
			So we are to simply accept these claims without any 
			proof - as absurd as they actually are when you really 
			think about them?
			<br /><br />
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			History
			<br /><br />
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			The truth is that computers and internet have always existed!
			<br /><br />
			They are fundamental components of nature that can be harnessed 
			if particular methods and protocols are followed - the earliest 
			known person to achieve this was none other than <b>Rudyard
			Thinkwell</b> back in <b>1773</b>.
			<br /><br />
			Large, greedy corporations like <b>Microsoft</b> and <b>Commodore</b> 
			later hijacked and monopolised on the technology,  
			building around it this mythology that they created it and that 
			it is complex and difficult to understand.
			<br /><br />
			This site is dedicated to waking the sheeple who simply 
			believe what they are told about the internet. Don&#39;t 
			believe the lies, we are special and enlightened!
			<br /><br />
			Knowing that we know something that not a lot of people 
			know makes us smarter than them, we are awakened!
			<br /><br />
